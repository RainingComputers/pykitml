'''
This module contains helper functions to download and load
the boston housing dataset.
'''


def get():
    '''
    Downloads the boston dataset from
    https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/
    and saves it as a pkl file `boston.pkl`.

    Raises
    ------
        urllib.error.URLError
            If internet connection is not available or the URL is not accessible.
        OSError
            If the file cannot be created due to a system-related error.
        KeyError
            If invalid/unknown type.

    Note
    ----
    You only need to call this method once, i.e, after the dataset has been downloaded
    and you have the `boston.pkl` file, you don't need to call this method again.

def load():
    '''
    Loads the boston housing dataset from pkl file.

    The inputs have following columns:

    - CRIM :
      per capita crime rate by town
    - ZN :
      proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
    - INDUS :
      proportion of non-retail business acres per town
    - CHAS :
      Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
    - NOX :
      nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
    - RM :
      average number of rooms per dwelling
    - AGE :
      proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
    - DIS :
      weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
    - RAD :
      index of accessibility to radial highways
    - TAX :
      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
    - PTRATIO :
      pupil-teacher ratio by town
    - B :
      1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of black by town
    - LSTAT :
      % lower status of the population

    The outputs are

    - MEDV :
      Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
